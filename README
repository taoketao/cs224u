Morgan Bryant, April 2018

This github repo will manage my code across OSes and distros.
Take note of the .gitignore, which will attempt to ignore all
machine-specific code and contained repositories.

Update: I've instead formatted this as a fork from the master
CS224U repository, for later pulls as the course progresses.

... after an excessive amount of effort, I've automated the 
packaging for a freshly initialized virtualenv. (Couldn't get
the bash script to activate the virtualenvs automatically.)
The packages jupyter-notebook and matplotlib now import 
successfully.


depr:

Due to unsolved issues on my Linux, I hereby remind myself to
    < $ venv/bin/jupyter-notebook [args] >    instead of
    < $ jupyter notebook [args] >,
  akin to < $ source venv/bin/activate >.
