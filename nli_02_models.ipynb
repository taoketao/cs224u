    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook defines and explores a number of models for NLI. The general plot is familiar from [our work with the Stanford Sentiment Treebank](sst_01_overview.ipynb):\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Models based on sparse feature representations\n",
    "1. Linear classifiers and feed-forward neural classifiers using dense feature representations\n",
    "1. Recurrent and tree-structured neural networks\n",
    "\n",
    "The twist here is that, while NLI is another classification problem, the inputs have important high-level structure: __a premise__ and __a hypothesis__. This invites exploration of a host of neural model designs:\n",
    "\n",
    "* In __sentence-encoding__ models, the premise and hypothesis are analyzed separately, combined only for the final classification step.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In __chained__ models, the premise is processed first, then the hypotheses, giving a unified representation of the pair.\n",
    "\n",
    "NLI resembles sequence-to-sequence problems like __machine translation__ and __language modeling__. The central modeling difference is that NLI doesn't produce an output sequence, but rather consumes two sequences to produce a label. Still, there are enough affinities that many ideas have been shared among these fields."

    "1. A high-level lesson of [the SNLI leaderboard](https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/snli/) is that one can do __extremely well__ with simple neural models whose hyperparameters are selected via extensive cross-validation. This is mathematically interesting but might be dispiriting to those of us without vast resources to devote to these computations! (On the flip side, cleverly designed linear models or ensembles with sparse feature representations might beat all of these entrants with a fraction of the computational budget.)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In an outstanding project for this course in 2015, [Leonid Keselman](https://leonidk.com) observed that [one can do much better than chance on SNLI by processing only the hypothesis](https://leonidk.com/stanford/cs224u.html). This relates to [observations we made in the word-level bake-off](nli_wordentail_bakeoff.ipynb) about how certain terms will tend to appear more on the right in entailment pairs than on the left.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. As we pointed out at the start of this unit, [Dagan et al. (2006) pitched NLI as a general-purpose NLU task](nli_01_task_and_data.ipynb#Overview). We might then hope that the representations we learn on this task will transfer to others. So far, the evidence for this is decidedly mixed. I suspect the core scientific idea is sound, but that __we still lack the needed methods for doing transfer learning__.\n",

    "1. For SNLI, we seem to have entered the inevitable phase in machine learning problems where __ensembles do best__."

    "1. When we [feed dense representations to a simple classifier](#Dense-representations-with-a-linear-classifier), what is the effect of changing the combination functions (e.g., changing `sum` to `mean`; changing `concatenate` to `difference`)? What happens if we swap out `LogisticRegression` for, say, an [sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html) instance?\n",

Implement the [Separate premise and hypothesis RNN](#Separate-premise-and-hypothesis-RNNs) and evaluate it, comparing in particular against [the version that simply concatenates the premise and hypothesis](#Simple-RNN). Does having all these additional parameters pay off? Do you need more training examples to start to see the value of this idea?\n",

    "1. The illustrations above all use SNLI. It is worth experimenting with MultiNLI as well. It has both __matched__ and __mismatched__ dev sets that are worth exploring. It's also interesting to think about combining SNLI and MultiNLI, to get additional training instances, to push the models to generalize more, and to assess transfer learning hypotheses."
